      <p class="pubs">Abstract: Predicting the duration of traffic incidents is a challenging task due to the stochastic nature of events. The ability to accurately predict how long accidents will last can provide significant benefits to both end-users in their route choice and traffic operation managers in handling of non-recurrent traffic congestion. This paper presents a novel bi-level machine learning framework enhanced with outlier removal and intra–extra joint optimisation for predicting the incident duration on three heterogeneous data sets collected for both arterial roads and motorways from Sydney, Australia and San-Francisco, U.S.A. Firstly, we use incident data logs to develop a binary classification prediction approach, which allows us to classify traffic incidents as short-term or long-term. We find the optimal threshold between short-term versus long-term traffic incident duration, targeting both class balance and prediction performance while also comparing the binary versus multi-class classification approaches using quantiled duration groups and varying threshold split. Secondly, for more granularity of the incident duration prediction to the minute level, we propose a new intra–extra Joint Optimisation algorithm (IEO-ML) which extends multiple baseline ML models tested against several regression scenarios across the data sets. Final results indicate that: (a) 40–45 min is the best split threshold for identifying short versus long-term incidents and that these incidents should be modelled separately, (b) our proposed IEO-ML approach significantly outperforms baseline ML models in 66% of all cases showcasing its great potential for accurate incident duration prediction. Lastly, we evaluate the feature importance and show that time, location, incident type, incident reporting source and weather at among the top 10 critical factors which influence how long incidents will last.<br>

Grigorev, T. Mao, A. Berry, J. Tan, L. Purushothaman and A. -S. Mihaita, doi: 10.1109/ITSC48978.2021.9564561.</h2>
		  
      <p class="pubs">Abstract: This paper explores the impact of electric vehicles (EVs) on traffic congestion and energy consumption by proposing an integrated bi-level framework comprising of: a) a dynamic micro-scale traffic simulation suitable for modelling current and hypothetical traffic and charging demand scenarios and b) a queue model for capturing the impact of fast charging station use, informed by traffic flows, travel distances, availability of charging infrastructure and estimated vehicle battery state of charge. To the best of our knowledge, this paper represents the first integrated analysis of potential traffic congestion and energy infrastructure impacts linked to EV uptake, based on real traffic flows and the placement and design of existing fast-charging infrastructure. Results showcase that the integrated queue-energy-transport modelling framework can predict correctly the limitations of the EV infrastructure as well as the traffic congestion evolution. The modelling approach identifies concrete pain points to be addressed in both traffic and energy management and planning. <br>

      <p class="pubs">Abstract: Predicting the traffic incident duration is a hard problem to solve due to the stochastic nature of incident occurrence in space and time, a lack of information at the beginning of a reported traffic disruption, and lack of advanced methods in transport engineering to derive insights from past accidents. This paper proposes a new fusion framework for predicting the incident duration from limited information by using an integration of machine learning with traffic flow/speed and incident description as features, encoded via several Deep Learning methods (ANN autoencoder and character-level LSTM-ANN sentiment classifier). The paper constructs a cross-disciplinary modelling approach in transport and data science. The approach improves the incident duration prediction accuracy over the top-performing ML models applied to baseline incident reports. Results show that our proposed method can improve the accuracy by 60% when compared to standard linear or support vector regression models, and a further 7% improvement with respect to the hybrid deep learning auto-encoded GBDT model which seems to outperform all other models. The application area is the city of San Francisco, rich in both traffic incident logs (Countrywide Traffic Accident Data set) and past historical traffic congestion information (5-minute precision measurements from Caltrans Performance Measurement System).

      <p class="pubs">Abstract: Recently, the problem of traffic accident risk forecasting has been getting the attention of the intelligent transportation systems community due to its significant impact on traffic clearance. This problem is commonly tackled in the literature by using data-driven approaches that model the spatial and temporal incident impact, since they were shown to be crucial for the traffic accident risk forecasting problem. To achieve this, most approaches build different architectures to capture the spatio-temporal correlations features, making them inefficient for large traffic accident datasets. Thus, in this work, we are proposing a novel unified framework, namely a contextual vision transformer, that can be trained in an end-to-end approach which can effectively reason about the spatial and temporal aspects of the problem while providing accurate traffic accident risk predictions. We evaluate and compare the performance of our proposed methodology against baseline approaches from the literature across two large-scale traffic accident datasets from two different geographical locations. The results have shown a significant improvement with roughly 2% in RMSE score in comparison to previous state-of-art works (SoTA) in the literature. Moreover, our proposed approach has outperformed the SoTA technique over the two datasets while only requiring 23x fewer computational requirements.

      <p class="pubs">Many accident modelling studies still rely on the reported accident data logs as ground truth, which can be affected by reporting errors. To avoid these errors, the actual accident duration can be estimated from traffic state readings. The ability to accurately predict how long accidents will last and which impact it will have on the traffic state can provide a significant benefit to both end-users (by providing better routes mitigating accident effects) and traffic operation managers (to determine how many resources need to be allocated in accident management). The study focuses on the San Francisco area in Unites States (83 detectors stations, 9,275 accident reports, 1,792 accident reports with Vehicle-Detector-Station (VDS) association).</p>
